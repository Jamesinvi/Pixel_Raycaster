# Pixel_Raycaster
This is an old learning project done in Processing. Uploaded from an archive (files have been reformatted or rewritten).
This raycaster uses grid cells as it's basic unit. Every cell checks for light/shadow using the **<ins>Bresenham's line algorithm</ins>**.
To make it faster results are cached so known cells don't have to recompute their line intersections
